# Defect Log

**Owner:** QA Lead · **Opened:** 2026-08-20 (Sprint 5)

> Named as a QA Lead deliverable in the charter at Sprint 0 and **not created
> until Sprint 5**. Three defects had already been found, fixed and written up
> in postmortems without ever being logged as defects. Backfilled below rather
> than started clean, because a log that begins the day it is noticed hides the
> period it was missing.

| ID | Found | Sprint | Severity | Description | Root cause class | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| D-001 | Sprint 3 | 2 | **1** | Refusal gate marked 150/265 unanswerable questions answerable — a 56.6% false-answer rate reported at the Sprint 2 gate as zero | Test set too small and too easy, written by the implementer | Fixed, guarded |
| D-002 | Sprint 3 | 3 | 2 | Evidence gate answered a value-demanding question the corpus never answers, scoring 8.85 | Similarity signals cannot distinguish "about this subject" from "answers this question" | Fixed, guarded |
| D-003 | Sprint 3 | 3 | 3 | Re-ranker experiment returned a null result that was two bugs: a NaN checkpoint and a saturated metric | NaN sorts as a no-op; document-level MRR was already 0.986 | Fixed, guarded |
| D-004 | Sprint 4 | 1 | 2 | Seed loader destroyed one embedding model's vectors when reloading under another | `chunk_embedding` cascades on chunk delete | Fixed, guarded |
| D-005 | Sprint 5 | 4 | 2 | Retry loop re-sent an identical prompt, so it could never succeed | Design oversight: the edge existed, the feedback did not | Fixed, guarded |
| D-006 | Sprint 5 | 4 | **1** | Semantic cache served the previous answer to a correction retry (0.886 similarity vs 0.60 threshold) | **Emergent interaction between two individually correct, individually measured components** | Fixed, guarded |
| D-007 | Sprint 5 | 4 | 2 | `RUN_BUDGET_USD=0` killed every run mid-stream with an unhandled error | Fail-fast not applied to configuration | Fixed, guarded |
| D-008 | Sprint 5 | 5 | 2 | CSP blocked React hydration in development; every button was inert HTML | A policy correct for production made development impossible | Fixed, guarded |
| D-009 | Sprint 5 | 5 | **1** | The console displayed assessments the governance layer had refused to emit | Rendering ignored the run outcome | Fixed, guarded |
| D-010 | Sprint 5 | 4 | **1** | Spend reservation priced against `providers[0]`, under-reserving 4x when failover reached a costlier provider | The guard assumed the cheapest candidate would serve | Fixed, guarded |
| D-011 | Sprint 6 | 6 | 3 | A comment inside a backslash continuation truncated the Semgrep invocation; the scan ran without its exclusion, printed success, and the shell exited 127 on the orphaned flag | Shell semantics: a comment ends a continuation. Every visible signal pointed elsewhere | Fixed, guarded |
| D-012 | Sprint 7 | 7 | 2 | No body-size limit on the run endpoint; a 200KB body reached the agent and returned 502 instead of being refused | Cost bounds were applied to spend and rate, but not to input length | Fixed, guarded |
| D-013 | Sprint 7 | 7 | **1** | The rate-limit pen test could not fail: it sent 8 requests against a limit of 20, and its pass condition accepted `all(c >= 400)`, so a service that was DOWN reported as correctly rate limited | A test written to pass rather than to detect | Fixed, guarded |
| D-014 | Sprint 7 | 7 | 2 | Traceability statuses drifted in both directions: 4 rows used statuses the legend never defined (`Done (design)`/`(gate)`/`(decision)`) which the delivery page counted as done, and 1 row sat at `Planned` while its test had passed for four sprints | A status column maintained by hand, rendered publicly as fact | Fixed, guarded |
| D-015 | Sprint 7 | 7 | 3 | The first README checker could not fail: it searched for each figure as a substring of the whole file, so changing `Commits \| 54` to 99 still passed because "54" appears in "54% of questions" | A guard written to confirm rather than to detect — caught only by deliberately corrupting a value | Fixed, guarded |
| D-016 | Sprint 7 | 7 | 2 | Sprints 6 and 7 were worked and shipped with no planning ceremony and no plan document; the sprint numbers existed only in defect-log entries, and a Sprint 5 retrospective commitment to raise exactly this was never honoured | Governance applied to the product but not to the process; the control relied on someone remembering | Fixed, guarded |
| D-017 | Sprint 8 | 8 | 2 | ADR-0003 placed the agent runtime on Hugging Face Docker Spaces "because it is free"; Docker Spaces are PRO-only, so three sprints of deployment work targeted a platform that cannot host it at $0 | A pricing claim recorded in an ADR without ever being read from the pricing page | Fixed, guarded |
| D-018 | Sprint 8 | 8 | **1** | CI never built the web application. A Dependabot PR taking Next 15→16 reported 10/10 green while the production build failed on all seven pages; no job had ever run `next build` | A pipeline whose green tick exercises none of the code under change | Fixed, guarded |
| D-019 | Sprint 8 | 8 | 2 | Two governance documents (PROJECT_RECORD.html, SPRINT_08_PLAN.md) asserted the web app was undeployed and Sprint 8 was blocked on credentials for a full week after the real deploy landed; caught only because the Product Owner quoted the stale text back and asked "true?" | The traceability guard catches a requirement claiming Done falsely (overclaiming); nothing caught a document claiming Blocked falsely once it resolved (underclaiming) | Fixed, guarded |
| D-020 | Sprint 9 | 9 | 2 | 20 of 45 `Planned` rows in the traceability matrix (BR-001/004/006/007/008/009/010, FR-002/005/006/007/010/014/015/016/020/025/026/027/029) had real, passing, CI-green tests months before the row was updated — a recurrence of D-014's exact root cause at 20x the scale, caught only by an explicit read-the-code-not-the-doc audit requested by the Product Owner ("I want all of the 45 to be done"). `PROJECT_RECORD.html` (the same document D-019 was found in) independently carried the same stale `13 done` / `45 Planned` figures in three places, hand-typed rather than generated | `check-traceability.mjs` (built for D-014) only fails the build in the overclaiming direction — a `Done` row with no matching test. It has never checked the reverse: a `Planned` row whose named-or-equivalent test already exists and passes, which the public delivery page then undercounts. `PROJECT_RECORD.html` is not generated from `delivery.json` at all, unlike the `/delivery` page and `README.md` — a third recurrence in the same file | Fixed (rows and HTML figures corrected); guard extension for the reverse direction, and generating PROJECT_RECORD.html's figures rather than typing them, are both open — see backlog |

## Where these were found, which is the finding

| Found by | Count |
|---|---|
| Running the assembled system | **5** (D-005, D-006, D-007, D-008, D-009) |
| Measuring against a large labelled set | 2 (D-001, D-002) |
| CI against a real database | 1 (D-004) |
| Re-running a measurement after a change | 1 (D-003) |
| Reading a trace the product renders about itself | 1 (D-010) |
| CI reporting a failure whose visible cause was wrong | 1 (D-011) |
| Running the security suite against a live system | 2 (D-012, D-013) |
| Deriving a public number instead of trusting the document | 1 (D-014) |
| The Product Owner quoting stale text back and asking "true?" | 1 (D-019) |
| Deliberately breaking a guard to see whether it notices | 1 (D-015) |
| The Product Owner asking a direct question | **1** (D-016) |
| Reaching the deploy and finding the platform had changed | 1 (D-017) |
| Building a dependency PR by hand instead of trusting its checks | **1** (D-018) |
| An explicit "verify the doc against the code, not the other way round" audit | 1 (D-020) |
| **Code review** | **0** |
| **Unit tests written before the defect** | **0** |

Not one of these was caught by review or by the existing test suite. Every one
was caught by executing something — the system, a measurement, or a container.

D-006 is the one that could not have been caught any other way. Both components
had correct tests. The cache's test asks whether two different *questions*
collide (0.208, correctly no). Nobody asks whether a prompt collides with its
own *correction* (0.886, yes) until the two are wired together and run.

## Policy

A defect is logged here when found, before it is fixed, with its root cause
class.

A guard is not trusted until it has been run against the defect it claims to
catch and observed to fail. D-011 and D-015 were both found that way, and D-015
would otherwise have shipped as a check that could never fail -- inside the
script written to stop exactly that. A defect that reaches a deployed environment additionally gets a
postmortem in `docs/06-operations/postmortems/`.

## D-011 in detail — when every visible signal points the wrong way

**Found:** 2026-08-21, CI (Security workflow), after the fix for D-010's sibling failures.
**Severity:** Medium — the gate reported failure, but for a reason that pointed nowhere.

**What happened.** Excluding a Semgrep rule meant adding a `--exclude-rule` flag to a
backslash-continued `semgrep scan` invocation. The justification was written as comment
lines directly above the new flag, inside the continuation. Bash ends a continuation at a
comment, so the shell ran `semgrep scan` *without* the new flag, printed a complete and
entirely plausible scan report, and then tried to execute
`--exclude-rule=trailofbits...` as a program:

    line 21: --exclude-rule=trailofbits...: not found
    ##[error]Process completed with exit code 127

**Why it cost a round trip.** Every visible signal was misleading. Semgrep printed
`Scan completed successfully`, the finding it was supposed to suppress still appeared, and
the exit code (127) belongs to the shell, not to the scanner. The obvious reading — "the
exclusion flag doesn't work" — was wrong; the flag was never passed.

**Fix.** Moved all commentary above the invocation so the continued flags are contiguous.

**Guard.** `scripts/check-workflow-shell.mjs`, run in CI's governance job, parses every
`run:` block in `.github/workflows` and fails on (a) a comment line following a line ending
in `\`, and (b) any block that fails `bash -n`. It was verified against the broken file
before being trusted: it reports `security.yml:129`, the exact line that produced the 127.

**Class.** Same family as the silent no-op string replacements logged earlier: an edit that
appears to have applied, produces confident output, and changes nothing. The standing
response is unchanged — assert the anchor before writing, and prove the guard fails on the
bug it claims to catch.
