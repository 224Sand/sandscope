# Design System

**Author:** UX/UI Designer · **Date:** 2026-08-20 · **Satisfies:** DR-001

> The UX/UI Designer role produced nothing for five sprints while DR-001 —

## 1. What the reference standard actually is

DR-001 names apple.com product pages. The instinct is to copy the *look*: black
background, large type, full-bleed imagery. That is the least transferable part.

What actually makes those pages work:

**Motion is scroll-driven, not autoplay.** The reader controls the pace. Nothing
happens on a timer, so nothing is missed by looking away.

**One idea per viewport.** Each pinned section makes exactly one claim, and the
next does not begin until the first has landed.

**Type carries the hierarchy, not colour.** Weight, size and spacing do the work.
Colour is reserved for meaning — which, for this product, means status.

**The technique is video and CSS, not a framework.** Scroll-scrubbed `<video>`,
`position: sticky`, `IntersectionObserver`. Near-zero JavaScript on the hot path,
which is also what NFR-003 requires.

**The honest divergence:** Apple is selling an object and can show it. This
product's subject is a *process* — evidence, refusal, governance. Photography of
a data centre would be decoration standing in for substance. So the hero of each
scene is **the system's own output**: a real trace, a real citation, a real
refusal. Stock footage is atmosphere at the edges, never the subject.

## 2. Colour

Black canvas, as specified. The palette is deliberately small: a product with
seven accent colours is a product where colour means nothing.

| Token | Value | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `--ground` | `#000000` | Page. True black, not near-black — the reference standard is specific about this and screens differ. |
| `--surface` | `#0B0B0D` | Raised panels |
| `--surface-2` | `#141417` | Nested panels, table rows |
| `--line` | `#26262B` | Hairlines. Never a border heavier than 1px. |
| `--text` | `#F5F5F7` | Primary |
| `--text-2` | `#A1A1A8` | Secondary |
| `--text-3` | `#6E6E76` | Tertiary, metadata |
| `--grounded` | `#3FB950` | A cited claim, a passing check |
| `--refused` | `#D29922` | A refusal, a warning, the probe suite |
| `--blocked` | `#F85149` | Awaiting approval, a failure |
| `--accent` | `#4C8DFF` | Interactive only. Never decorative. |

**Status colour is the only colour with meaning**, and the three states map
exactly to the product's three outcomes: grounded, refused, blocked. A reader who
learns those three colours can read any screen.

Contrast: every text token meets WCAG AA on its intended ground. `--text-3` on
`--surface-2` is 4.6:1 and is used only for metadata that is never the sole
carrier of information.

## 3. Type

One family. `ui-sans-serif, -apple-system, "SF Pro Text", "Inter", system-ui` —
the system stack renders natively on the reader's platform and costs zero bytes.
A webfont for a page this type-heavy would cost more than it returns.

Monospace for anything the system produced: `ui-monospace, "SF Mono", "JetBrains
Mono", monospace`. **Machine output is always monospace.** A reader should be
able to tell prose from evidence without reading either.

| Role | Size | Weight | Tracking | Leading |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Display | `clamp(2.75rem, 7vw, 6.5rem)` | 600 | `-0.045em` | 0.95 |
| Headline | `clamp(1.75rem, 3.5vw, 3rem)` | 600 | `-0.03em` | 1.1 |
| Title | `1.25rem` | 590 | `-0.01em` | 1.3 |
| Body | `1.0625rem` | 400 | `0` | 1.55 |
| Caption | `0.8125rem` | 450 | `0.01em` | 1.4 |
| Mono | `0.875rem` | 400 | `0` | 1.6 |

Negative tracking on large sizes and none on body. Display type set at default
tracking is the single most common tell of a page that was not designed.

## 4. Space

A 4px base, used as `4 · 8 · 12 · 16 · 24 · 32 · 48 · 64 · 96 · 128`. Nothing
between. Arbitrary values are how a layout stops having rhythm.

Section rhythm: `96px` on mobile, `128px` above 768px. Panels: `24px` internal.
Measure capped at `68ch` for body prose.

## 5. Motion

### Principles

**Motion explains or it does not happen.** Every animation in this product either
shows causality (a signal propagating from one service to its dependents), state
change (a claim gaining a citation), or progress (a node completing). Decorative
motion is rejected at review.

**The reader sets the pace.** Scroll-driven, never timed. A visitor who stops
scrolling stops the animation.

**Nothing is reachable only by animating.** AC-C10. Content is present in the DOM
and legible with animation removed; motion changes emphasis, never availability.

### Tokens

| Token | Duration | Curve | Used for |
|---|---|---|---|
| `--t-instant` | 100ms | `linear` | Hover, focus |
| `--t-quick` | 200ms | `cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1)` | State change, toggles |
| `--t-considered` | 420ms | `cubic-bezier(0.16, 1, 0.3, 1)` | Panel entry, scene transitions |
| `--t-scrub` | — | scroll-linked | Video scrub, pinned scenes |

The `considered` curve decelerates hard — it settles rather than arrives, which
is what makes the reference standard feel unhurried.

### Scroll-scrubbed video

Encoded as H.264, 1920×1080, 30fps, CRF 24, **under 7 seconds per scene, under
4.5 MB**. A budget, enforced in CI by `scripts/check-media.mjs`: a clip that
exceeds it does not merge.

Relaxed from 4s / 2.5MB in Sprint 9. Four seconds is short enough that an
ambient background visibly restarts while a reader is still inside the
paragraph it sits behind, and the loop point becomes the thing you notice
instead of the writing. The extra headroom also pays for CRF 24 rather than 26,
which is where this page's near-black gradients stop banding. It is a
relaxation, not an abandonment — the ceiling still refuses clips, and the
largest committed file sits at 4.03 MB against it.

Until Sprint 9 the sentence above said "enforced in CI" while no workflow had
ever opened a media file; the budget lived inside `fetch-media.mjs`, which runs
on a laptop when somebody chooses to. The check now reads the committed
artefacts, because the encoder is not what ships.

Requirements that are not negotiable:
- `preload="auto"`, `muted`, `playsInline`, no `autoplay`
- Keyframe every 6 frames, or seeking stutters
- A poster frame that is meaningful on its own
- **Below 768px, or under reduced motion, the poster frame replaces the video
  entirely.** Scrubbing a video on a phone spends the user's data to produce a
  worse experience than the still.

### Reduced motion

`@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)` is not an afterthought path. Under it:
scrubbed video becomes its poster, pinned sections become ordinary stacked
sections, transitions collapse to `--t-instant`, and **nothing is hidden**.

## 6. Components

**Evidence panel.** Monospace, `--surface-2`, hairline left border in
`--grounded`. Each citation is a button, not a link — it reveals the passage
in place rather than navigating away, because a reader checking a citation has
not finished reading the claim.

**Verdict chip.** The three states, in their colours, with the score. Always
carries a text label as well as a colour: colour alone fails for the ~8% of men
with a colour-vision deficiency, and this is status information.

**Trace waterfall.** Rows are spans, width is duration, indentation is
parentage. Provider hops and cache outcomes are annotations on the row, not a
separate view — the question "why did that take 900ms" is answered in one place
or it is not answered.

**Approval block.** `--blocked`, full-width, the proposed action verbatim, and
two buttons of equal visual weight. **Approve is not the primary action.** A
gate where one choice is styled as the obvious one is not a gate.

## 7. What this system deliberately does not have

No shadow scale — hairlines and surface levels carry elevation. No border radius
above 12px. No gradient except the single page-edge vignette. No icon set beyond
what status requires. No dark/light toggle: the product is one thing.

Every omission is one fewer decision per screen, and the reference standard's
real lesson is restraint rather than polish.
