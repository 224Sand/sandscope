"""The trained classifier as served.

The parity test is the one that matters. ADR-0009 splits training from serving,
and an export step is where numerical behaviour changes silently: without a
check, "the model is deployed" and "the trained model is deployed" are different
claims that look identical from outside.

These tests import onnxruntime, which is a RUNTIME dependency. They do not
import scikit-learn, which is not.
