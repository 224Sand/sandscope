"""Contract and cost requirements, asserted rather than asserted-in-prose.

Two requirements in the traceability matrix carried the status `Done (design)`:
the decision had been taken and written into an ADR, but no test asserted it.
`Done (design)` is not in the matrix's own legend, and the delivery page counted
it as done, so the public number was inflated by claims nothing checked.

These are the two tests those rows named. Writing them is the honest way to
close the gap; downgrading the rows would have been the other.

AC-001 -- the experience layer is separated from the agent runtime. The value
of that split is only real if the two sides agree on the contract, and they can
drift silently because nothing imports across the boundary.

NFR-002 -- zero infrastructure cost. Now testable for the first time, because
deployment manifests exist as of Sprint 7.
