"""Workload definitions.

A workload is DATA, not a graph. Incident triage and change review run through
the same compiled orchestration graph with different task profiles, because the
central claim of a control plane is that it is workload-agnostic and a second
graph would prove nothing about that.

What a workload supplies:

  * how to turn its input into a retrieval query
  * how to frame the task for the model
  * how to score the risk of what it proposes - deterministically, never by
    asking the model how risky its own suggestion is
  * what its action is called, so the approval record reads as something a human
    can decide about
