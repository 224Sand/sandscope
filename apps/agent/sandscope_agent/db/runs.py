"""Persistence for runs, approvals and session memory.

Runs stream within a single request (api/app.py explains why), so nothing about
executing a run requires storage. Two things that happen AFTER a run do:

  * an approval decision arrives minutes later and must find the run it belongs
    to (ADR-0006: the decision creates a NEW run carrying the record)
  * a session's later runs should be able to recall its earlier ones

Both are reads of a completed run, which is why persistence lives here rather
than in the graph. The graph does not know this module exists.
