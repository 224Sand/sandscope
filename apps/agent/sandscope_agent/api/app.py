"""FastAPI surface for the agent runtime.

Runs on Hugging Face Spaces behind the Next.js BFF (ADR-0001, ADR-0003). The
browser never reaches this service directly and never holds its token.

One design decision worth stating: a run STREAMS WITHIN A SINGLE REQUEST rather
than being started by one call and polled by another. Cross-request run state
would have to live somewhere, and the container's disk is ephemeral (NFR-005)
while a restart mid-run would strand the client on a run id that no longer
exists. One request, one stream, no shared state to lose.
