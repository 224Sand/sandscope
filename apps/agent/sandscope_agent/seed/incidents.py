"""Incident and telemetry generation.

Reproducibility is the contract: an incident is fully determined by its seed, so
a triage run that goes wrong can be replayed exactly from the seed alone rather
than described.

The generated telemetry is what makes an incident diagnosable. The root service
moves first; services in its blast radius move later, attenuated by graph
distance. That time ordering is the diagnostic signal, and it is the thing the
agent has to reason from.
