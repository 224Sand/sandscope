"""Approximate nearest neighbour benchmark (FR-030).

The question worth answering is not "is HNSW fast". It is **at what corpus size
does an ANN index start earning its cost**, because this system's corpus is 87
chunks and the honest expectation is that exact search wins outright at that
scale. A benchmark that only reported HNSW latency would confirm a decision
nobody should make.

So: exact search is ground truth, HNSW and IVFFlat are measured against it for
recall AND latency across four corpus sizes, and the crossover is reported.

Synthetic vectors are drawn as a mixture of Gaussians around random centroids
rather than uniformly at random. Uniform vectors in 768 dimensions are nearly
equidistant, which is the worst case for any ANN index and would flatter exact
search for a reason that has nothing to do with real embeddings.

Three corrections after the first run produced numbers that could not be
believed:

  1. Timing was client wall-clock, so every measurement read 65-68ms regardless
     of method or corpus size - the round trip to the database, not the query.
     "HNSW wins at 87 vectors" was 65.38ms against 65.41ms on a 65ms floor.
     Timing now comes from EXPLAIN ANALYZE's server-side execution time.
  2. Recall collapsed to 0.16, which says more about the fixture than about
     HNSW. 24 clusters over 20,000 points makes the top-10 neighbours near-ties,
     so exact and approximate disagree while both are defensible. More
     centroids and a tighter spread give a well-posed ranking to recall against.
  3. Tuning was applied with session-level SET. The connection is Neon's POOLED
     endpoint, which pools in transaction mode, so session state does not
     survive between statements and ivfflat.probes never took effect. Tuning is
     now SET LOCAL inside the same explicit transaction as the query.
