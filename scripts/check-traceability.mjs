/**
 * The traceability matrix must not claim more than the repository can show.
 *
 * The matrix defines exactly three statuses -- Planned, Building, Done -- and
 * defines Done as "implemented, test green in CI". Both halves of that were
 * being violated silently:
 *
 *   - rows used statuses the legend never defined (`Done (design)`,
 *     `Done (gate)`, `Done (decision)`), and the delivery page counted every
 *     one of them as done because it matched on the prefix. The public number
 *     was inflated by claims nothing checked.
 *   - one row sat at `Planned` while the test it named had been passing for
 *     four sprints, so the same number was also understated.
 *
 * Hand-maintained status drifts in both directions. This makes it a build
 * failure instead.
